Point of Attention:
Without an external database, you can only use the following bookmarklets on EXPA:
* v2_EXPA_add_finance (will add a new link to the linklist)
* v2_EXPA_analytics_raises (show raises in Analytics)
* v2_EXPA_analytics_signups (show signups and allows creation of graphical reports in Analytics)
* v2_EXPA_followUpTable (right now includes also stuff from external database but can easily be adapted)
* v2_EXPA_removePercentage (removes percentage in Analytics)
* v2_EXPA_showProgram (shows program interested in instead of program experience in in My EPs)

Step 13: PROFIT!!!
